		spent six years as a Research Scientist at Stanford University, and one
		year at Xerox PARC. McIlraith is the author of over 100 scholarly
		publications in the area of knowledge representation, automated
		reasoning and machine learning. Her work focuses on AI sequential
		decision making broadly construed, through the lens of human-compatible
		AI. McIlraith is a fellow of the ACM, a fellow of the Association for
		the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and a past President
		of KR Inc., the international scientific foundation concerned with
		fostering research and communication on knowledge representation and

		the 32nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-18). She also
		served as program co-chair of the International Conference on Principles
		of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR2012), and the
		International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC2004). McIlraith's early work
		on Semantic Web Services has had notable impact. In 2011 she and her
		co-authors were honoured with the SWSA 10-year Award, a test of time
		award recognizing the highest impact paper from the International
		Semantic Web Conference, 10 years prior; in 2022 McIlraith and
		co-authors were honoured with the 2022 ICAPS Influential Paper Award,
		recognizing a significant and influential paper published 10 years prior
		at the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling;
		and in 2023 McIlraith and co-authors were honoured with the IJCAI-JAIR
		Best Paper Prize, awarded annually to an outstanding paper published in
		JAIR in the preceding five years.
