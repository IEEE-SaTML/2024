We negotiated a <b>room rate of $149 per night</b> with the conference hotel.
<b>Please use the provided link to make a reservation</b> or use the group code
<b>SATML</b> when booking through Hilton's website, otherwise the conference

room block. Click on "Edit Stay" at the top of the booking page to change the
dates before making a reservation. <b>The cut-off date for reservations within
this room block is January 9, 2023.</b>
