		<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Title:</h1> (Certified) Robustness in
		Machine Learning: A Five-Year Retrospective
		<br>
		<br>

		<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract:</h1> In order to deploy deep
		learning models in safety critical domains, we need something more than
		models that work well "in expectation": we need models that are (perhaps
		certifiably) robust to worst-case scenarios. This argument has been a
		common refrain in adversarial deep learning, but is there much evidence
		that it is true? More than five years after the development of several
		practical techniques for improving adversarial robustness of large-scale
		models, these techniques are still not widely deployed, nor do they seem
		to be on the verge of deployment. Meanwhile, for better or worse, the
		wide-scale deployment of (non-robust) models seems to have only
		accelerated.
		<br>

		In this talk, I will offer a bit of historical context about how these
		certified robustness methods evolved, the notable advances that have
		been happening over the past five years, and thoughts on why we still
		seem so far from deploying robust models in practice. I will discuss
		some of the largest challenges in the space, and possible directions for
		moving forward.

		<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Biography:</h1> Zico Kolter is an
		Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie
		Mellon University, and also serves as chief scientist of AI research for
		the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence. His work spans the
		intersection of machine learning and optimization, with a large focus on
		developing more robust and rigorous methods in deep learning. In the
		context of robust machine learning in particular, his group developed
		several early methods for certified robustness, including convex
		relaxations for verifying deep networks, and randomized smoothing
		approaches. He is a recipient of the DARPA Young Faculty Award, a Sloan
		Fellowship, and best paper awards at NeurIPS, ICML (honorable mention),
		AISTATS (test of time), IJCAI, KDD, and PESGM.
