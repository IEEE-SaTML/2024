		<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Title:</h1> Causing harm while claiming
		to build Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
		<br>
		<br>

		<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract:</h1> The stated goal of many
		organizations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) is to develop
		artificial general intelligence (AGI), an imagined system with more
		intelligence than anything we have ever seen. Without questioning
		whether such a system can and should be built, researchers working
		towards AGI have created the field of AI safety to attempt to make AGI
		that is “beneficial for all of humanity.” I argue that unlike systems
		with specific applications which can be evaluated following standard
		engineering principles, undefined systems like “AGI” cannot be
		appropriately tested for safety. With specific examples, I outline how
		the march towards building AGI has resulted in systems that harm
		marginalized groups and centralize power, while their creators claim to
		“benefit humanity." I conclude by urging the field to work on defined
		tasks and applications for which we can develop safety protocols, rather
		than attempting to build a presumably all knowing system such as AGI.

		Timnit Gebru is the founder and executive director of the Distributed
		Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (DAIR). Prior to that she was
		fired by Google in December 2020 for raising issues of discrimination in
		the workplace, where she was serving as co-lead of the Ethical AI
		research team. She received her PhD from Stanford University, and did a
		postdoc at Microsoft Research, New York City in the FATE (Fairness
		Accountability Transparency and Ethics in AI) group, where she studied
		algorithmic bias and the ethical implications underlying projects aiming
		to gain insights from data. Timnit also co-founded <a href="http://blackinai.org/" target="_blank"
			class="fw-bold">Black in AI</a>, a
		nonprofit that works to increase the presence, inclusion, visibility and
		health of Black people in the field of AI, and is on the board of
		<a href="https://www.addiscoder.com/" target="_blank" class="fw-bold">AddisCoder</a>, a
		nonprofit dedicated to teaching algorithms and computer programming to
		Ethiopian highschool students, free of charge.
